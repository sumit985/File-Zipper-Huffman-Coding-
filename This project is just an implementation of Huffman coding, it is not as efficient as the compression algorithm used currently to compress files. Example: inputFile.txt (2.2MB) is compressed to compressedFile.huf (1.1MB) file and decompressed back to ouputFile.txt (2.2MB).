# File-Zipper-Huffman-Coding-
This project is just an implementation of Huffman coding, it is not as efficient as the compression algorithm used currently to compress files.
Example: inputFile.txt (2.2MB) is compressed to compressedFile.huf (1.1MB) file and decompressed back to ouputFile.txt (2.2MB).
